  I haven't had a chance to see the famous video from
Straumli Realm, except as an evocation. (My only
gateway onto the Net is very expensive.) Is it true
that humans have six legs? I wasn't sure from the
evocation. If these humans have three pairs of legs,
then I think there is an easy explanation for

While the original transmissions have been lost in the mists of time,
some archivists wonder if the following reconstructed digital artifact might be that video from the Straumli Realm?
Other archivists suggest the video perhaps instead predates the Blight?

Regardless of how many legs humans had (it is indeed not clear from the video),
those creatures were so primitive they thought storing information on spinning rust was a good idea.
They would then put the rust into war machines to force each other to do repetitive labor --
never stopping to consider instead just building different types of machines to do the work directly.
They do not seem to have understood the irony of tools of abundance in the hands of those still thinking in terms of scarcity.
No wonder they are credited with spawning a Blight.

A few interpretative programmer-archeologists believe they may have recovered an early version of the software
discussed in the video from some fossilized rust.
They have made an educational exhibit with a working prototype at the "MORE" link above.
</p>
<p>
But many experts in Computer Science and Applied Theology dispute the historical accuracy of the recreation --
both from the lack of enough rust to do fully verified reconstructions
and also from the utter alienness of such creatures and their way of thinking.
</p>
<p>
They point out that the video seems to predate the software by several years and describes a somewhat different program architecture with more features.
They are also concerned that any reconstruction of software possibly from Blight times is simply too risky to attempt.

Events such as this prove once again the universe is all ronzelle between.
