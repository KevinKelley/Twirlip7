You can set the editor mode above from "javascript" to "markdown" to get syntax highlighting for markdown.  
You can also change it to "html" or "fortran" for other examples.  
Remember to change it back to "javascript" later when looking at JavaScript again.

Examples of using __markdown__.

\`console.log("hello");\`

### THINK

Before you speak:

* T - is it *true*?
* H - is it *helpful*?
* I - is it *inspiring*?
* N - is it *necessary*?
* K - is it *kind*?
